4.  The quarterly meetings of the Members shall be held on the second Thursday in the months of January, April, July and October in each year, beginning with the year 2018, at 7:00 pm, to discuss budgeting and the overall financial situation of the business  in addition to any business as may come before the meeting.

5. Members may designate any place within a ten mile radius of the City of Seattle, as the place of meeting for any quarterly.  If no designation is made, or if a special meeting is otherwise called, the place of meeting shall be the principal office of the organization in the City of Seattle, Washington.

6. Written, printed, electronic notice stating the place, day, hour, and purpose or purposes of the meeting for which the meeting is called, shall be delivered not less than 14 days before the date of the meeting, either personally or by mail, by or at the direction of the president, or the secretary, or the officer or persons calling the meeting, to each member of record entitled to vote at such meeting. If mailed, such notice shall be deemed to be delivered, when deposited in the United States mail, addressed to the member at his address as it appears on the membership application, with postage thereon prepaid.

7. Quorum: Any decision to be made that affects the bylaws, membership, mission, formation and dissolution of committees, location or time of regular meetings, or any other major decision must be made during a meeting in which at least two-thirds of the membership is present. Such decisions will be announced a week in advance. All other decisions must be made at a meeting where at least one half of the collective membership is in attendance.

8.  Absence from meetings
    A.  At all meetings of Members, a Member may vote by proxy executed in writing by the Member. Such proxy shall be filed with the secretary of the organization before or at the time of the meeting. No proxy shall be valid after 30 days from the date of its execution unless otherwise provided in the proxy.
    B.  If a member is not able to attend a meeting where major decisions are being made and fears that their absence might undermine quorum, the member may exempt themselves from quorum by communicating this to the collective, or strongly request that the collective postpone the decision until the member can participate.

A special meeting as called by the members may be located within or without the State of Washington as chosen by the members.

10.  In the event that the meeting does not yield a consensus on an issue...

	
### Section 2: Membership

1.  Any person is eligible to become a member of this Collective, provided the following conditions are met:
    
2.  Collective Membership is voluntary, and is based on approval by the existing Collective. Prospective members must agree to work within the existing by-laws of the Collective.

3.  All of Project Ambri’s Collective documents, meetings, and meeting notes, and other operating agreements are open to scrutiny by any Collective member.

4.  Collective members shall:
    A.  Actively contribute to production, administration or operations of the Collective.
    B.  Attend, or make a good faith effort to attend, monthly full collective meetings.
    C.  Be committed to collective process, including, but not limited to consensus-based decision-making and the maintaining of an egalitarian work place.
    D.  Fullfill their assigned tasks in a manner that serves to support the maintenance of existing Collective projects.
    E.  Maintain a community space that provides educational material and events in accordance with the goals and values of the Collective.
    F.  Work a minimum number of hours of 20 hours per month in one of the Collective’s projects.

5.  Every active worker-owner at Project Ambri is an equal member of the Collective, with an equal voice in the business. Departments determine who counts as active, but the Collective as a whole can override these determinations. Good faith attendance at monthly full-collective meetings will be a prerequisite of active membership.

6.  A member may take a leave of absence from the collective during which time the above responsibilities and privileges shall not remain in force. Upon reinstatement by the Collective, the member’s responsibilities and privileges resume.

7.  Collective members which meet the above requirements are termed active members. Collective members who do not meet the above requirements(to be reviewed on a quarterly basis) are to be considered inactive members. An inactive member loses the ability to block decisions, to count against quorum, and to participate in voting, but still retains access to the store, is welcome at closed meetings of the collective, and counts as a “full collective member” for the purposes of scheduling. Inactive members may be reinstated as active by the decision of the Collective.

8. When a member leaves the collective voluntarily, all issues related to keys, passwords, and the disbursement of shared property will be determined by the collective on a case-by-case basis.

### Section 3: Revocation of Membership and Expulsion from the Collective

1. Revocation of Membership: Any member may have their membership with the Collective revoked for deliberate or repeated conduct deemed by the membership to be detrimental to the Collective. The member in question must be strongly encouraged to attend the meeting where the revocation is decided, and shall have an opportunity to dispute the charges. While the collective member’s membership is in question, the Collective may suspend the rights of the member in question to work, volunteer, vote, and act as or claim to be a member of the Collective until said member attends a meeting. The person in question may appeal revocation of their membership. Such an appeal shall be voted on by the membership, following an opportunity for the member to be heard, orally or in writing, at the meeting. In the event that a member refuses to attend a meeting at which their membership revocation is to be decided upon, a decision can be arrived at by a qurom of the remaining collective. 

2. A collective member who no longer has membership as a result of revocation will be treated for all other purposes like a collective member who has voluntarily left the collective.

3.   Expulsion from the Collective is reserved for behavior sufficiently transgressive or destructive that it substantially impacts other members or conflicts with the values of the AF (as defined in Article I, Section 4.) The expulsion process will follow the procedure for revocation of membership, in addition to a permanent ban from all premises and events held by the Ambrielan Foundation.

4.   A member who is alleged by another member to have performed one of the following acts is banned from the premises immediately and until an emergency closed collective meeting can be held:
    * sexual or other physical assault on a collective member or other space-user
    * theft or malicious destruction of collective property or property on the premises
    * clandestine collaboration with law enforcement or intelligence services
    * illegally using or distributing drugs in or around the premises
    Failure to observe this ban will result in automatic expulsion.
 
5.  The purpose of the emergency meeting is to determine the factual circumstances of the event and the appropriate    collective response up to and including expulsion from the Collective.

6.  All decisions at these emergency meetings will follow the procedure for "major decisions" outlined in section 2.1.7.

7.  Other forms of obnoxious, harassing, or abusive behavior will be addressed through Project Ambri’s grievance procedure, with membership revocation or expulsion as possible outcomes.

8. The Collective maintains the right to hold individual collective members, prospective collective members, or other non-member employees personally liable for financial losses or damage to assets deemed by the Collective to have resulted from grossly negligent or malicious behavior on the part of said individuals. Such a decision falls under the procedure for “major decisions” in section 2.1.7.

## ARTICLE III: Paid employees

### Wages

1.  The AF’s minimum wage will be .
    “Base wages” will be defined as the Red Emma’s “minimum” wage
    rate/hour, plus 50% of any additional hourly wage. “Surplus wages”
    will be defined as the remaining 50%.
2.  Base wages will be paid every two weeks in a timely fashion.
    Surplus wages will be paid on a quarterly basis, but only after a
    determination by the LLC that the business was and will continue to
    be sufficiently profitable to make this distribution of wages to
    members a wise decision.
3.  The hourly wage rate will, at the discretion of the LLC, and on an
    annual basis, be adjusted upwards , when the LL elects to:
    1.  raise the base wage of every worker-owner
    2.  establish a raise for current and future worker-owners based
        on the length of time they have been members of the LLC
    3.  establish a raise for current and future worker-owners based
        on the total number of hours they have worked to date

4.  However, at no point is the LLC allowed to raise wages such that
    the difference between the highest paid and lowest paid member
    exceeds a 2:1 ratio.
5.  Additionally, the LLC may elect to give one-time bonuses to all
    members, either in equal amounts or based on the amount of hours
    worked in a given period. Such bonuses should reflect anticipated
    surpluses, but do not need to wait for the final determination of
    profit/loss at the end of the fiscal year. Such bonuses should be
    treated, for tax purposes, as extra wages.
6.  In the event that the business enters a period of temporary
    financial distress, Red Emma’s worker-owners have the option of
    allowing their wages to accumulate in their capital accounts, rather
    than being distributed to them in cash. It is encouraged that no
    wages retained in this way remain in the member’s capital account
    for any period longer than one year.

### Hiring

1.  Hiring takes place either:
    1.  When a department cannot fill allocated hours from within the
        current collective
    2.  When a department receives an allocation of additional paid
        hours from the full collective at a quarterly budgeting meeting,
        or in exceptional circumstances, at a monthly meeting.

2.  The hiring process will be as follows:
    1.  The department forms a hiring committee
    2.  The department can solicit applicants in whatever way makes
        sense to them. This could be very informal, or involve a
        publicly advertised position
    3.  After narrowing down the candidates to people who they feel
        should get an interview:
        1.  The names of those candidates are circulated to the full
            collective; there is a three day window before any interview
            can take place in case someone has a blocking concern
        2.  A person from outside the hiring department, selected by
            the advisory council, joins the hiring committee and takes
            part in the interviews and selection of person to be
            hired.

    4.  Once a candidate has been selected:
        1.  The candidate can start paid work immediately in a
            probationary period, as an employee of Red Emma's.
        2.  After at least 1 month + 20 hrs of work, after a
            departmental review, the new hire is interviewed by the full
            collective at a monthly collective meeting.
        3.  If the full collective approves the hire, they become a
            prospective collective member.  A prospective collective member remains an employee of Red Emma's, but may enjoy additional privileges and responsibilities as outlined elsewhere in these by-laws.

    5.  After three months:
        1.  There is another departmental review.

    6.  After six months as a prospective collective member:
        1.  After a final departmental review, the full collective
            reviews the new hire, and if there are no blocking concerns,
            the prospective member is added to the LLC as a member and becomes a collective member.
	2.  If either the department or the full collective determines
   	    the new hire is not ready for collective membership at six
   	    months, the process may be extended for up to an
   	    additional six months, with a final review at both levels
   	    necessary before become a member of the LLC and
   	    collective.

    8.  All reviews are recorded and kept on file, and are geared to
        provide a standardized formula for evaluation.
    9.  The existence of scheduled reviews by a department or the full
        collective do not preclude termination for gross incompetence or
        malicious behavior.

### Departments

1.  The day-to-day work of the collective shall be carried out by the
    following departments:
    1.  Food Department

        recordkeeping, accounting, and tax/regulatory compliance)

2.  Departments will meet regularly, and will be responsible for

### Grievance Procedure

1.  Collective members and prospective collective members can present
    grievances against individuals or the Collective as a whole to the
    Collective during regular meetings. Such grievances will be
    considered priority agenda items.
2.  If the intent of presenting a grievance is to seek mediation or
    intervention from the Collective in redress of the grievance, it
    should be treated as a major decision as outlined in section 2.2.
3.  It is within the rights of the person presenting a grievance to
    request that the meeting (or portion of a meeting) in which the
    grievance will be aired be closed to all but full collective
    members. If the grievance involves individual collective members or
    prospective members, the individuals airing the grievance may
    request that the meeting (or relevant portion of the meeting) be
    closed to the individuals against whom the grievance was made. These
    individuals also have the right to request that they have an
    opportunity to meet with the Collective without the presence of the
    individuals who originally brought forth the grievance. No decisions
    may be made by the collective regarding the grievance without both
    parties involved being given the opportunity to return to the
    meeting.
4.  If a meeting has been closed in accordance with 6.3, the collective
    can decide to reopen the meeting in order to pursue
    resolution/redress or to continue discussing the grievance.
5.  The collective may seek outside mediation if it is unable to
    successfully resolve a grievance.
